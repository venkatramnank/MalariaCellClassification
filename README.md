The trained model is available as a H5 file.

## Description 
The binary classification of parasitic and non parasitic malaria cells is obtained using a CNN model. The Image generator for the model undergoes Image augmentation before being given as input. The final accuracy obtained is 89 percent.

## Initiative
This project comes under the initiative to delve into usage of Deep learning in Medical Imaging field.
